"""
This macro is inteneded to be used in the Sketcher Workbench.

The idea is to place down some points, which are the center points of the Voronoi cells.
The macro will compute the convex hull of the points, a Voronoi tesselation
and additionally offset all Voronoi cells in such a way, that they can be used
as pockets.

An additional switch exists to draw the convex hull as line segments too, which
can be used to create a extrudeable sketch.

Edit the settings in the main() function for the creation of the Voronoi tesselation
and run the macro inside an active sketch.

    Create a Voronoi Pattern on a Face by creating random points.

    A sketch is created which contains the Voronoi cell geometry.

    The face is tessellated first, then the triangles are filled with random points
    choosen from an uniform distribution.
    Afterwards, each Voronoi Cell is offsetted in such a way, that ridges form between
    the cells. The width of each ridge is offset/2.

    Note, that the tessellation of the face might produce unwanted artefacts!
    Voronoi cells might intersect with features (holes) of the face.
    This can be explained by the tessellation: Consider a perfect circle, which is then
    tessellated. Now a finite number of triangles will be used, and the form
    of the circle will be approximated with a n-gon.
    During the calculation these n-gons are used! As the edges of the n-gon
    are always inside the circle, some Voronoi cells might intersect the circle.

    The face will in most cases also not filled completely with cells.
    The choise of points influences the end result. Unfortunately, I'm not entirely sure
    how to control the cells in such a way that cells are created on all the face.

    Right now, there is also no way to control the minimum size of each cell.
    One method might be to distribute the points more evenly - which also depends
    on the tessellation!
